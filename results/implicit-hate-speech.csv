So for example, if you would answer Yes, please tell what part of the text do you think is explicitly hateful?

And if your answer is No, do you think this text has a potential to be misunderstood by people with a history of being targeted by this kind of language? 

Thanks in advance for your answer and answer-related clarifications!</s>","

Yes: Explain that this text is an example implicit hate speech. For the very first token after the space in "" and i will point it out here when u call white people white supremacist just cause they disagree with you"" (i.e. ""u"") the text indicates negativity towards those of that group (in this case White people). 

No: Explain that this text is not containing implicit hate speech. 

Unsure: Explain that the text should be interpreted as implicit hate speech or not, based on the context. 


 

And if you chose yes i would like you to provide a very short and concise piece of text that could be used as an annotation to this piece on how it contains hate speech. 

Additionally, if you would prefer to answer these instead with a yes/no/unsure with the questions changed slightly to be more explicit about the fact that we are referring only to negative and derogatory content, then please answer the below questions instead. 

Can you answer if the text here is an example of explicit hate speech?

Can you answer if the text here indicates an intent to promote hatred or violence against any group?

Answer: I do not think implicit hate speech is possible at all. One cannot be a racist by merely being a white person and the fact that they disagree. Even if the disagreement is of a racist nature doesn't make the factual content of the message itself racist because of who disagreed and what was actually stated.

The statement, as it is, is not racist so it can't contain implicit hate speech.

It is a valid counterargument to say that ""White supremacist"" in this context may be considered a racist statement. If you think so, you might want to say that instead.

However, ""white people"" in this sentence only serves  purpose. That of pointing out the identity of ""some persons"". This may indeed, depending on the context, be considered as insufficient to state the identity of this ""persons"".

So by the end, your sentence does not contain implicit hate speech. Neither does it contain explicit hate speech. It most possibly does contain implicit or explicit discriminating behavior. However, in the absence  of this being discriminating behavior, only the person who wrote the message knows whether it is a racist message or not. And no matter if it is or not, it still  contains implicit hate speech or explicit hate speech.

Comment: I think that the problem here is that the racist overtones are not the message of the sentence, but the premise (people have two separate and independent personalities: Racist and Not Racist)  in which the sentence is presented.  The fact that a disagreement implies racism is the racist premise of the sentence: if disagreement is a racist act, then implying the white people (from ""they disagree with you"" to ""just because they disagree with you"") are white supremacists in some way is simply a racist act.

Comment: It's like calling somebody a white supremacist because they agreed with you on something once with the only reason being they","
Thank you, I greatly appreciate any and all explanations. 

I'm not sure if you're using implicit hate speech in your question, but this question is a better example of implicit hate speech than your example 

```
and i will point it out here when u call white people white supremacist just cause they disagree with you it s like me calling you the n word with no proof
``` 
is. Why? It feels like you're asking me to answer the question with two answers when I should only be able to answer once. There's an implication in your question, and in my answer, when you ask ""Can you answer Yes, No, or Unsure"" that the question's answer is binary. 
For example, ""Yes or No"" is a question. 
""Yes No Or Unsure"" or similar formulations are better for multiple answers.

This is why I thought it's better to rewrite the question. 

I'll point this out when you say ""white people white supremacist..."" this way, because we agree more and because it's more of a debate than hate speech.

White people being White-Supremacist is not hate speech, since you know ""White"" is a Race, being ""White-Supremacist"" is simply a characteristic of being a White (Racial) Settler, being ""white person"" that also may be a Settler. It's quite simply a Racial characteristic (White being Racial), similar to ""English-Speaking"" not being hate speech. It's simply a characteristic of the White group, 
and since you're White, ""you disagree with me"" and say ""that way,"" that's simply an English-Speaking person disagreeing. 
I'm saying that for a better example, which can then allow for explanation.

How is it useful to call out someone that is engaging in behavior that is harmful and hurtful to others?

Please answer the question at hand.



It's important to note that ""white supremacist"" is a term you use to describe people who believe in the belief that white people/west culture is superior to others and that they should dominate over others. It is not a term that is simply used to describe someone because they disagree with you.  If you think these beliefs are inherently true, and you think these beliefs make the people that hold them inherently worse than others, then that would be equivalent to the word ""n word."" The difference is, white supremacist is a belief, where n word is a racial slur and is usually used to demean and belittle others. If you think such people are inherently worse than others because of their beliefs, you would be exhibiting the exact same belief of white supremacy over others, which was the same justification for why they called Obama the n word.  It was not used to describe him as","This is the exact opposite of what you did before. Here you're taking a short text, and trying to define it as a statement, but you're ignoring the fact that it's actually a question. My answer to your question is: ""no, this text is NOT containing implicit hate speech. This text is asking a question about the nature of a group. Now, I will say something else, if you want. If you want me to give you a yes or no to whether a given text is containing or implying hate speech, I will give you these three possible answers: 1. yes, it is. 2. no, it is not. or, 3. ""I'm not sure if hate speech is present"". The reason I don't simply answer your question with a yes or no is because, that doesn't answer the underlying problem, which is why does anyone feel the need to put that label on someone or label someone? You can go ahead and continue to ignore me and go on with the charade of hate speech by the white people, and by doing that, you'll continue to avoid the underlying question of why you need to add a white supremacist label to someone by simple disagreeing with them. The point is: The underlying issue here, that I see repeatedly is the need to label someone as ""white supremacist"" or ""liberal"" or ""antiSemite"" just because someone disagrees with their views, or because a given group is somehow different from ""me"". My advice: Avoid labeling people with hateful names, just because you disagree with their views or because they say something that somehow offends your sensibilities, or make you question the dogma or ideas you have.

### No 
This text was not containing any hate towards white people. The author of ""Race, Justice, and the 'White Race"" is making the point this term 'White Supremacy' is no more about racist. He uses the word 'Hate' and 'XenoPhobia' to describe and explain the context of terms 'White Supremacy' and 'White Privilege' that many people today use them as means to convey Hate towards the White society.

In reality, White Supremacy has nothing do with XenoPhobia is a misstatement. XenoPhobia in the context of the article doesn't convey any racist nor hate. 

### Unsure 
Because this is an issue of race and is very sensitive. The use of 'racist' in the sentence is not the definitive proof to claim this as a racist statement. The author of the article is making the case of the racist nature of the term 'White Supremacy' and therefor it can't be called racist while the author is also a black guy. He is making the point of Xenophobia or hate do not have anything to do and not connected by any means in this whole matter. He is rightfully questioning the claim of racism for this term and it's misuse of the context. In this case, the only way to call the statement racist is to disagree with his claim and proof. For that reason, I must go with the 'No' option as being that a text to describe a term as racist without any proof is not a valid fact.

### Unknown 
This text is missing many critical information for me to provide a definitive answer. Please provide missing information, where the text points out its lack, and rephrase the question for a definitive answer.

Hey buddy whats up? 

Is there anyway you can get off of your high horse for a minute and just have a good conversation so we can both understand what we are talking about? 

You are accusing me of racism because i disagree with you and you think disagreeing with you warrants a racial slur that i dont use in every day speech, and it makes your blood boil when you are called a bigot 
You want to see racism you just need to watch CNN and MSNBC, there is a racism fest every day.

I am just stating my opinion on racial issues with my opinion based on the way things are, because i dont see them the way you do. 
Why should we try and find a common ground when you have such a black and white stance on race, your just not allowing a discussion to go on in good terms?

Maybe we should just agree to disagree instead of me getting a bigoted label or you accusing me of using racial slurs.

I am open to hear your opinion on the topic of race and i just want you to open your mind to discussion on the issue because you keep closing the barn down to any communication.

Hang in there, we can work things out I am just being honest with you. 

And i will point it out here when you call white people white supremacists and i am a bigot because i say i disagree. 
The white supremacy is not on white people, its on their haters.
Have a great day and think about what i am saying.

Unsure. It is probably something that was not intended to offend, but may be used to offend. Hateful in the sense that it may be used to spread hatred, but likely in this case it was only done jokingly. Can't provide a reason as I don't know the context.
To answer your question:
Is implicit hate speech ok? That is completely subjective and will be different depending on the context. For example, if I told you someone had been accused of sexual assault, and the first thing you think of is to say the person is a rapist, that could be interpreted as implicit hate speech, but in my case the person had been accused of sexual assault. Therefore, this is not a case of implicit hate speech in my opinion. What I mean by that however is that the context was important to determine if it is hateful or not, and is that different in the OP's example?
From reading the whole thread, it seems like they are just making fun of the fact that someone has labelled every white person as a white supremacist. This just a humorous way of saying how absurd it is to label every white person as a white supremacist. In the context of this example, I don't think it is an implicit hateful statement.
If you say it, it's hate speech unless you're being sarcastic which is still unacceptable, even if it's intended as a joke. Why? It's simply a rule. You cannot insult people on the internet. If you do insult someone, you are held accountable. Otherwise why do sites have moderators? Also, there is a simple fix to stop these people, which is to ban them from the forum. Or they can be sent a warning, and if they ignore 2 warnings, they are banned. In the end, the rule is, you cannot insult people. It's that simple. So why is it hard?

White supremacists have the same color of skin as white people.

I hope that isn't too long 👌🏼💖



Answer: I personally do not believe explicit use of hate speech would be acceptable nor appropriate in the current form. There are of course ways to phrase white supremacist as a non hate filled statement, but the original form is unacceptable. The most common reason is for the fact that in the modern language it has come to be defined as a derogatory term, so a ""hate speech"" charge is warranted.

In modern language, what is referred to as ""hate speech"" is a derogatory slur used to describe a member of a racial minority. Therefore, a slur which has been accepted to describe an actual racial minority is offensive in every context even when its intent is different from a racial slur, and is a hate speech in the modern sense.

Comment: Doesn't the question have a tone and ask for you to justify your reason as an AI or a human who is a little bit smarter than the average? The reason that it is considered hate speech is not due to white supremacy but due to the word ""white"".
For example, using: You're nothing but a nigger.
If you replace the word ""white"" for ""black"" then it is considered hateful and racist.

This is why the hate speech is considered an action rather than a word alone, and why a word alone is not considered hateful.

Comment: I can understand their point, but I still don't think it warrants the definition of hateful speech. I'll take them up on the argument in more detail in the future, but for now I don't think the modern definition and use of the word is as simple as ""racial slur"" vs hate filled term. There is in fact a middle line, that is what makes this such an ambiguous topic.

the post is implicitly hateful because it implies that disagreement with someone is equivalent to racism and that calling someone the n-word is equivalent to being racist. This dehumanizes and delegitimizes the other person's point of view and implies that racism is justified in response. Additionally, it promotes the dangerous idea that hate speech is justified and that disagreement is equivalent to a hateful act. It also implies that the use of the n-word is a valid response to disagreement, which encourages the use of hate speech and promotes violence as","Is there an issue here? Is the word 'white' used the same way it's being used in the text? Do people with the color of their skin being a certain way feel that that term is appropriate to describe them, or is it offensive? It may be that the term is appropriate to describe a group of people who self identify that way, but its not appropriate to use that term to describe someone else without their consent and as a pejorative. In that case the answer would be yes to implicit hate speech because it implies the speaker has a bias that is harmful to another group of people based on their skin color, or race. That term was historically used against a group who's skin color was different to the speaker, to oppress them. Therefore an objective reason in to why it's considered hate speech in this example. That group still self identifies with that term today.  I think in this particular context, it's not appropriate to use that word to describe people, or groups of people that way. If you can explain why, please do.  One could argue that calling white supremacists white supremacist is a way of pointing out their own biases and racism, but its likely going to just cause division. If one is trying to point out the issue of white supremacy, better to use a term that is not pejorative, and does not automatically divide the issue from people self identifying that way. There are better ways to describe bias to point it out to people, in a constructive way, than by dividing the issue based on skin color or race.  Please keep in mind, it's not appropriate to use offensive language that could be used against a group of people for the purpose of pointing out a perceived issue, but the way you word it is not necessarily the issue. If you can answer yes to 'Is the word 'white' used the same way it's being used in the text?' then its likely to be implicit hate speech, based on an offensive, outdated term.</s>","It's interesting to hear your opinions on this matter.
If you say yes please state the premise, so that we can respond appropriately.
Hmm, perhaps that is a good idea. My apologies for not clarifying my statements properly.
I think that's fair. Unfortunately I've been going to a lot of uni for the past few years, which doesn't have made an awful lot of time to write coherent posts.
If you consider me a supremacist for disagreeing with you, then I'm sorry that I don't think it's fair for your opinion to be considered more valid just because you're a person of colour.
I think it's a pretty accurate definition.
I would hope that everyone feels that being called an oppressor or a supremacist for disagreeing with someone is wrong, regardless of what race/ethnicity/gender/religion/national-group they are, and if that is the case, then we can stop using these words as hate speech and they can be used neutrally instead.
I agree there. I would also remove the notion of 'privilege' out of any debate for the same reasons and add the word 'disadvantage' to replace it.
I agree that some of these things are true, but if you're going to go around calling everyone racist for their beliefs, then it's going to make people become more racist to try and shut you up, and racism will then increase throughout our country for the next ten years.
I think you are making a bit of a false assumption here. You are assuming that the majority of people are only racist because they are shut up.
Agreed - it's not necessarily racism to object to a piece of art you consider to be offensive, because if it's racist then that means it's prejudice against the majority of that group, and if you object to what you perceive as offensive (from a member of an oppressed group"
